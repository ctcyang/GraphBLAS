# GraphBLAST

GraphBLAST is a GPU implementation of [GraphBLAS](http://www.graphblas.org), an open standard for building blocks of graph algorithms. It gives data scientists without GPU programming experience the power to implement graph algorithms on the GPU. We are the leading graph framework in the following metrics:

- **Performance**: The first high-performance GPU implementation of GraphBLAS
- **Composable**: A library with building blocks for expressing most graph algorithms
- **Concise**: Single-source shortest path (SSSP) on GPU can be expressed in a mere 25 lines of code
- **Innovative**: Combines state-of-the-art [graph optimizations](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/021076bn) from [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock) with the direction-optimization heuristic of [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra)

## Prerequisites

This software has been tested to build with the following dependencies:

* CUDA 11.3
  * (Change: CUDA > 11 is now required)
* Boost 1.74
* g++ 8.3.0
  * (Change: C++14 is required)

Optional:

* CMake 3.11.1

## Install

A step by step series of instructions that tell you how to get a development environment running GraphBLAST.

1. First, you must download the software:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gunrock/graphblast.git
```

2. The current library is set up as a header-only library. To install this library, copy the graphblas directory, its subdirectories and the specific platform subdirectory (sans the platform's test directories) to a location in your include path. However, there are 2 source files that need to be compiled with your program (`ext/moderngpu/src/mgpucontext.cu` and `ext/moderngpu/src/mgpuutil.cpp`).

We provide two build toolchains using `Makefile` and `CMake`. The user can choose either of them.

### Option 1: Using Makefile

```
cd graphblast
make -j16
```

### Option 2: Using CMake

```
cd graphblast
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Usage

Single Source-Shortest Path (Bellman-Ford SSSP) example (see the [graphblas/algorithm]() directory for more examples):

```c++
#include "graphblas/graphblas.hpp"

// Single-source shortest-path on adjacency matrix A from source s
graphblas::Info ssspSimple( Vector<float>*       v,
                            const Matrix<float>* A,
                            Index                s,
                            Descriptor*          desc ) {
  // Get number of vertices
  graphblas::Index A_nrows;
  A->nrows(&A_nrows);

  // Distance vector (v)
  std::vector<graphblas::Index> indices(1, s);
  std::vector<float>  values(1, 0.f);
  v->build(&indices, &values, 1, GrB_NULL);

  // Buffer vector (w)
  graphblas::Vector<float> w(A_nrows);

  // Semiring zero vector (zero)
  graphblas::Vector<float> zero(A_nrows);
  zero.fill(std::numeric_limits<float>::max());

  // Initialize loop variables
  graphblas::Index iter = 1;
  float succ_last = 0.f;
  float succ = 1.f;

  do {
    succ_last = succ;
    
    // v = v + v * A^T (do relaxation on distance vector v)
    graphblas::vxm<float, float, float, float>(&w, GrB_NULL, GrB_NULL,
        graphblas::MinimumPlusSemiring<float>(), v, A, desc);
    graphblas::eWiseAdd<float, float, float, float>(v, GrB_NULL, GrB_NULL,
        graphblas::MinimumPlusSemiring<float>(), v, &w, desc);

    // w = v < FLT_MAX (get all reachable vertices)
    graphblas::eWiseMult<float, float, float, float>(&w, GrB_NULL, GrB_NULL,
        graphblas::PlusLessSemiring<float>(), v, &zero, desc);

    // succ = reduce(w) (do reduction on all reachable distances)
    graphblas::reduce<float, float>(&succ, GrB_NULL,
        graphblas::PlusMonoid<float>(), &w, desc);
    iter++;

    // Loop until total reachable distance has converged
  } while (succ_last != succ);

  return GrB_SUCCESS;
}
```

## Concepts

The idea behind GraphBLAS is that four concepts can be used to implement many graph algorithms: vector, matrix, operation and semiring.

### Vector

A vector is a subset of vertices of some graph.

### Matrix

A matrix is the adjacency matrix of some graph.

### Operation

An operation is the memory access pattern common to most graph algorithms (equivalent Ligra terminology is shown in brackets):

- `mxv`: matrix-vector multiply (EdgeMap)
- `vxm`: vector-matrix multiply (EdgeMap)
- `mxm`: matrix-matrix multiply (multi-frontier EdgeMap)
- `eWiseAdd`: elementwise addition (VertexMap)
- `eWiseMult`: elementwise multiplication (VertexMap)

See [graphblas/operations.hpp](https://github.com/gunrock/graphblast/blob/master/graphblas/operations.hpp) for a complete list of operations.

### Semiring

A semiring is the computation on vertex and edge of the graph. In standard matrix multiplication the semiring used is the `(+, x)` arithmetic semiring. In GraphBLAS, when the semiring is applied to this operation, it represents the transformation that is required to transform the input vector into the output vector. What the `(+, x)` represent are:

- `x`: computation per edge, generates up to `num_edges` intermediate elements
- `+`: computation in the reduction of intermediates back down to a subset of vertices, up to `num_verts` elements

The most frequently used semirings (with their common usage in brackets) are:

- `PlusMultipliesSemiring`: arithmetic semiring (classical linear algebra)
- `LogicalOrAndSemiring`: Boolean semiring (graph connectivity)
- `MinimumPlusSemiring`: tropical min-plus semiring (shortest path)
- `MaximumMultipliesSemiring`: tropical max-times semiring (maximal independent set)

See [graphblas/stddef.hpp](https://github.com/gunrock/graphblast/blob/master/graphblas/stddef.hpp) for a complete list of semirings.
